# ESLint Config New Tab Example

What you’ll see: a custom new tab page with ESLint configured from the start.
How it works: the extension overrides the new tab and the project includes an ESLint configuration and scripts to enforce code quality.

Comes with ESLint ready to enforce code quality from day one.

## Installation

```bash
npx extension@latest create <project-name> --template new-config-eslint
cd <project-name>
npm install
```

## Commands

### dev

Run the extension in development mode.

```bash
npm run dev
```

### build

Build the extension for production.

```bash
npm run build
```

### preview

Preview the extension in the browser.

```bash
npm run preview
```

## Browser targets

Chromium is the default. You can explicitly target Chrome, Edge, or Firefox:

```bash
# Chromium (default)
npm run dev

# Chrome
npm run dev -- --browser=chrome

# Edge
npm run dev -- --browser=edge

# Firefox
npm run dev -- --browser=firefox
```
